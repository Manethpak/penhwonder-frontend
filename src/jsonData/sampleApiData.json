And there's huge benefits for those of us who do tend to take life a little less seriously, including emotional maturity and decision-making...but as we become adults, it can be easy for us to take life a little too seriously, and forget to, or not see the importance of play. \n\nBut what does playfulness look like for busy adults, and why is it important for our happiness and wellbeing? We should not be feeling guilty about playfulness, silliness and fun, we should be celebrating it! \ud83d\udd7a\ud83c\udffd\n\nIn this workshop we'll discuss happiness, playfulness, and some of the science behind it. You'll also come away equipped with some new ideas to bring more playfulness into your daily life!\n\nWe'll then begin our art activity - get ready to cut, sew, glue and craft the most wondrously pointless and silly face mask and let your inner child creativity loose! \n\n\u2022 Price is $10 per person (Maximum 10 person per session- spaces fill up fast so please book!).\n\u2022 Wednesday, 27th January from 5pm-7:30pm (2.5hrs)\n\u2022 Tea and cookies provided! \n\nFor booking contact Olivia, email hougholivia@gmail.com or msg this page\n\nSee you there, let's play!\n\n",

        "description": "Do you know BJJ and Kettlebell training are like cookies and chocolate chips, that are meant to be together?\n\nThe first reason being the tremendous carry-over to your performance on the mat. \n\nExplosive Hip drive, an iron grip, and increased cardiovascular endurance are some of the obvious reasons you should be incorporating Kettlebell training in your practice. \n\nAlso not unimportant, as we practice a non-fatigue-seeking approach to training you'll be able to improve your strength and performance without being too sore to train BJJ after.\n\nHow does that work?! No worries, I'll explain that during the workshop. The principles of the teachings are under those of Pavel Tatsouline, the Godfather of Kettlebells. Expect strong attention to detail for every movement that is being taught, along with some playful elements that combine into an easy to absorb and hard to forget experience.\n\n\"Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day.

their positive energy into their return to the stage and have the privilege to perform at Factory Phnom Penh, the capital city\u2019s creative hub resolutely turned towards the future! \n\nBy launching this six week circus season in 2021 - following the Government\u2019s sanitary protocol - we are giving citizens of Phnom Penh and beyond the opportunity to discover two of Phare\u2019s most emblematic shows: Influence and Samaki. \n\nThey share Cambodian stories through drama, dance, live music & modern circus arts and are inspired by the real-life experiences of its creators and performers, dealing with themes such as war, discrimination, relationships, poverty and ghosts.\n\nAdults and children alike will also get the chance to practice circus tricks with the performers during workshops organized every Tuesday and Saturday. Along with the shows played every Thursday (Influence) and every Sunday (Samaki), they will remind us all how arts have the power to unite and connect in times of crisis.\n\n*HEALTH SAFETY\nHealth safety measures will be in effect, please help protect yourself and others during the shows and follow the measures strictly.

Ten thousand miles from home, Marianna is extremely fond of singing the moving Southern Gospel and Bluegrass songs which instantaneously transport her back to her roots. \n\nMusicians Joe (guitar/vocals) and Mark (Mandolin) draw on a centuries-old British tradition of folk and Celtic music. Joe plays regularly in \u2018Cambodia Country Band\u2019 while Mark is the man behind Khmer-Fusion legends 'Kampot Playboys'.\n\nMarianna, Mark and Joe bring their combined influences to Grass Snake Trio: a barn-storming, heartstring-tweaking and barrel-slapping live acoustic band. Join us on the Farm for a superb roots session!",

during workshops organized every Tuesday and Saturday. Along with the shows played every Thursday (Influence) and every Sunday (Samaki), they will remind us all how arts have the power to unite and connect in times of crisis.\n\n*HEALTH SAFETY\nHealth safety measures will be in effect, please help protect yourself and others during the shows and follow the measures strictly.

their positive energy into their return to the stage and have the privilege to perform at Factory Phnom Penh, the capital city\u2019s creative hub resolutely turned towards the future! \n\nBy launching this six week circus season in 2021 - following the Government\u2019s sanitary protocol - we are giving citizens of Phnom Penh and beyond the opportunity to discover two of Phare\u2019s most emblematic shows: Influence and Samaki. \n\nThey share Cambodian stories through drama, dance, live music & modern circus arts and are inspired by the real-life experiences of its creators and performers, dealing with themes such as war, discrimination, relationships, poverty and ghosts.\n\nAdults and children alike will also get the chance to practice circus tricks with the performers during workshops organized every Tuesday and Saturday. Along with the shows played every Thursday (Influence) and every Sunday (Samaki), they will remind us all how arts have the power to unite and connect in times of crisis.\n\n*HEALTH SAFETY\nHealth safety measures will be in effect, please help protect yourself and others during the shows and follow the measures strictly.

their positive energy into their return to the stage and have the privilege to perform at Factory Phnom Penh, the capital city\u2019s creative hub resolutely turned towards the future! \n\nBy launching this six week circus season in 2021 - following the Government\u2019s sanitary protocol - we are giving citizens of Phnom Penh and beyond the opportunity to discover two of Phare\u2019s most emblematic shows: Influence and Samaki. \n\nThey share Cambodian stories through drama, dance, live music & modern circus arts and are inspired by the real-life experiences of its creators and performers, dealing with themes such as war, discrimination, relationships, poverty and ghosts.\n\nAdults and children alike will also get the chance to practice circus tricks with the performers during workshops organized every Tuesday and Saturday. Along with the shows played every Thursday (Influence) and every Sunday (Samaki), they will remind us all how arts have the power to unite and connect in times of crisis.\n\n*HEALTH SAFETY\nHealth safety measures will be in effect, please help protect yourself and others during the shows and follow the measures strictly.
